                        Happy Birthday! ðŸŽ‰ As the new college life at WashU
                        unfolds before me, with all the excitement and
                        challenges of <i>movin&apos; out</i>, I often find
                        myself reflecting on our moments together. I remember
                        the countless times Iâ€™d roll my eyes when you&apos;d
                        start one of your lectures on the most random of topics.
                        Funny how things change, because now, I find myself
                        missing those impromptu lessons. It&apos;s strange to
                        think that your words, which I sometimes took for
                        granted or considered background noise, have become the
                        echoes of wisdom I crave amidst the clamor of college
                        life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our bonding moments meant the world to me, and I cherish
                        them even more now, being miles away from home. I miss
                        watching stupid movies with you like Murder Mystery or
                        Barbie (which was especially stupid). I miss playing
                        pickleball with you. I miss bonding over Billy Joel in
                        the car. I miss going out and enjoying great food
                        together. These memories keep me grounded and remind me
                        of where I come from and the values you instilled in me.
                        I can&apos;t thank you enough for shaping the person I
                        am today.
                    </p>
                    <p className="mb-[10px]">
                        On this special day of yours, I want you to know how
                        much you mean to me. Every lecture, every song, every
                        word of wisdom â€“- they all matter. They always have, and
                        they always will. Happy birthday, and here&apos;s to
                        many more! Look forward to seeing you guys soon!
