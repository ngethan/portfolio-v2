                        During the research paper unit, I gained knowledge about
                        how to conduct online research utilizing databases, how
                        to produce a scholarly paper using MLA style, how to use
                        all of NoodleTools&apos; capabilities, and what tools
                        schools provide their students with to assist them
                        achieve. I&apos;ll be sure to utilize the general and
                        subject librarians, online databases, and other lending
                        services offered by the library at my campus. I am
                        really happy that I studied this course as a senior in
                        high school since I feel ready to conduct college-level
                        research today.

                        1. Build a strong foundation. Gathering sources and
                        compiling note cards is a crucial step in making the
                        writing process easier.
                        <br />
                        2. NoodleTools is the best tool for organizing sources
                        and taking notes and is offered for the low price of
                        $15/yr.
                        <br />
                        3. Write the body paragraphs first to make writing the
                        introduction and conclusion easier.
                        <br />
                        4. I learned how to create an outline with NoodleTools.
                        <br />
                        5. Utilize NoodleTools to compile my sources into a work
                        cited page.
                        <br />
                        6. All the plagiarism rules I learned were very
                        important. I found that I barely knew any of them, yet
                        they are extremely important to make sure none of your
                        paper is marked as plagiarized.
                        <br />
                        7. Printing out your paper and correcting it with a red
                        pen makes catching errors easier.
                        <br />
                        8. Peer review and feedback can help improve the quality
                        of a research paper.
                        <br />
                        9. I also learned a lot of the grammar rules that you
                        must follow like putting the period outside of the
                        quotation when you cite an author.
                        <br />
                        10. Lastly, saving Ms. Valenzaâ€™s tools on google drive
                        ensures that I will retain this information for when I
                        go off to college next year.
